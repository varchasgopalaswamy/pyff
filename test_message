pyff is a python package intended to parse AST of two files and check if the code meaninfully differs. You need to write tests to make sure the code works properly. The best thing to do is have a base python test file that implements commonly used patterns - classes, functions, decorators, variables, etc - and then write files that change one aspect of the original file. Then you can see if pyff correctly detects the change in the file. Make sure you use uv to create a virtual environment to support these development, and install pyff and pytest.
